Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.\n\nWhile denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the \"uncanny valley\" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.",

On the other hand, they are cheap and easy to service and upgrade, so in the end they became even more popular for the less fortunate. Since cyberlimbs are more capable than most natural limbs, and you can load them up with all sorts of wiz tech, this kind of cyberware has stayed in high demand.\n\nCyberskulls and - torsos are included in the \"cyberlimbs\" category, though they are in fact shells rather than full replacements (or actual limbs).\n\nCyberlimbs have their own Strength and Agility ratings. When a particular limb is used for a test (such as leading an attack with your cyberarm), use the attribute for that limb (natural or cyber); in any other case, take the average value of all limbs involved in the task. If a task requires the careful coordination of several limbs, use the value of the weakest limb. The attributes of partial limbs (including cyberhands and - feet) may be enhanced, but their attributes only apply for tests directly involving those limbs (such as a Strength Test when gripping something with an enhanced cyberhand). Cyberlimbs cannot hold any bioware, nor any cyber-implants that take up Essence rather than Capacity. Essence cost, Capacity, and other stats can be found on the Cyberlimb table.\n\nCyberlimbs have other useful features. They give you 1 extra damage box on your Physical Condition Monitor for each cyberlimb you possess (ignore hands and feet, and partial limbs count for half a limb). They have Capacity, letting you add cyberweapons and other cyber systems that have a Capacity cost {in brackets}. They can perform at superhuman levels with the right enhancements. Cyberlimbs can be dangerous even if they don't have cyberweapons installed - their unarmed Damage Value is (STR)P.\n\nCyberlimbs: These prosthetics are basic off-the-shelf models. All standard cyberlimbs come with Strength and Agility attributes of 3. These values can only be augmented by cyberlimb enhancements, not other augmentations.\n\nCustomization: You can have your cyberlimb tailored and customized to your frame and musculature. Customization lets you add to your limb's base Strength and/or Agility ratings. Each increase of either attribute increases the limb's Availability and cost. If either of your limb's attributes are increased beyond your natural maximum for that attribute, you can't use the cyberlimb (so don't overdo it), but you can still add cyberlimb enhancements.

They are often chromed or matte colors but visibly mechanical in nature. Some folks like them glaringly obvious and outlandish, some find the artificiality repellant and disturbing. This can affect your social dealings in some circles, especially upper-crust society and the purist crowd.\n\nSynthetic cyberlimbs: Synthetic limbs are disguised as natural limbs.

                      "description": "In today's world of transplant-friendly bioware, the use of cyberlimbs is sometimes viewed as crude and outdated. On the other hand, they are cheap and easy to service and upgrade, so in the end they became even more popular for the less fortunate. Since cyberlimbs are more capable than most natural limbs, and you can load them up with all sorts of wiz tech, this kind of cyberware has stayed in high demand.\n\nCyberskulls and - torsos are included in the \"cyberlimbs\" category, though they are in fact shells rather than full replacements (or actual limbs).\n\nCyberlimbs have their own Strength and Agility ratings. When a particular limb is used for a test (such as leading an attack with your cyberarm), use the attribute for that limb (natural or cyber); in any other case, take the average value of all limbs involved in the task. If a task requires the careful coordination of several limbs, use the value of the weakest limb. The attributes of partial limbs (including cyberhands and - feet) may be enhanced, but their attributes only apply for tests directly involving those limbs (such as a Strength Test when gripping something with an enhanced cyberhand). Cyberlimbs cannot hold any bioware, nor any cyber-implants that take up Essence rather than Capacity. Essence cost, Capacity, and other stats can be found on the Cyberlimb table.\n\nCyberlimbs have other useful features. They give you 1 extra damage box on your Physical Condition Monitor for each cyberlimb you possess (ignore hands and feet, and partial limbs count for half a limb). They have Capacity, letting you add cyberweapons and other cyber systems that have a Capacity cost {in brackets}. They can perform at superhuman levels with the right enhancements. Cyberlimbs can be dangerous even if they don't have cyberweapons installed - their unarmed Damage Value is (STR)P.\n\nCyberlimbs: These prosthetics are basic off-the-shelf models. All standard cyberlimbs come with Strength and Agility attributes of 3. These values can only be augmented by cyberlimb enhancements, not other augmentations.\n\nCustomization: You can have your cyberlimb tailored and customized to your frame and musculature. Customization lets you add to your limb's base Strength and/or Agility ratings. Each increase of either attribute increases the limb's Availability and cost. If either of your limb's attributes are increased beyond your natural maximum for that attribute, you can't use the cyberlimb (so don't overdo it), but you can still add cyberlimb enhancements. You customize your cyberlimb when you buy it; you can't customize it after purchase, but you can add enhancements.\n\nCyberlimbs may be either obvious or synthetic.\n\nObvious cyberlimbs: These implants are immediately recognizable as artificial limbs unless you cover them with clothing. They are often chromed or matte colors but visibly mechanical in nature. Some folks like them glaringly obvious and outlandish, some find the artificiality repellant and disturbing. This can affect your social dealings in some circles, especially upper-crust society and the purist crowd.\n\nSynthetic cyberlimbs: Synthetic limbs are disguised as natural limbs. The fact that they're cybernetic gives them a -8 Concealability (the Cybertechnology skill may replace Perception for this test) when someone's just looking, but synthetic limbs are obviously artificial to the touch.",

Ultrasound is perfect to \"see\" textures, calculate distances between objects, and pick up things otherwise invisible to the naked eye (like people cloaked by an Invisibility spell), it can't handle colors or brightness. It also can't penetrate materials like glass that would be transparent to optical sensors. You can set it to a passive mode, where it doesn't emit ultrasonic pulses but still picks up ultrasound from outside sources, such as motion sensors or someone else's ultrasound sensors on active mode (or bats).",

Physical and emotional stress can force your pump to activate if you fail a Composure Test (p. 152); otherwise you can trigger it as a Free Action.\n\nWhile the pump is active, you ignore injury modifiers and don't fall unconscious, even if your Stun Condition Monitor is filled. You can't rest, but the adrenaline pump's Rating is added to your Strength, Agility, Reaction, and Willpower attributes. The pump works for Rating x 1D6 Combat Turns (the pump can't be switched off early). When time's up, you crash and take Stun damage equal to the number of Combat Turns the pump was active (use your natural Body + Willpower to resist the damage).\n\nAfter the effects end, your attribute values return to normal and you stop ignoring injury modifiers or unconsciousness from Stun damage. After use, the pump requires 1 hour to regenerate its supply. During that time, it cannot be activated.",

Incorporating a small camera and laser range finder, the smartlink keeps track of ammunition, heat buildup, and material stress. If you have a smartlink, you can mentally switch between gun modes, eject a clip, and fire the gun without pulling the trigger. The camera lets you shoot around corners without exposing yourself to return fire (at a -3 dice pool penalty). The system makes use of advanced calculation software, allowing for precisely calculated trajectories and high precision over any distance.\n\nIf you're using a smartlink, the smartgun system increases the gun's Accuracy by 2. The smartgun features are accessed either by universal access port cable to an imaging device (like glasses, goggles, or a datajack for someone with cybereyes) or by a wireless connection working in concert with direct neural interface.\n\nRetrofitting a firearm with an internal smartgun system doubles the weapon's price and adds 2 to its Availability. An external smartgun system can be attached to the top mount or underbarrel mount with an Armorer + Logic (4, 1 hour) Extended Test. The small camera has a capacity of 1 and can be equipped with vision enhancements (p. 444).",

On the other hand, they are cheap and easy to service and upgrade, so in the end they became even more popular for the less fortunate. Since cyberlimbs are more capable than most natural limbs, and you can load them up with all sorts of wiz tech, this kind of cyberware has stayed in high demand.\n\nCyberskulls and - torsos are included in the \"cyberlimbs\" category, though they are in fact shells rather than full replacements (or actual limbs).\n\nCyberlimbs have their own Strength and Agility ratings. When a particular limb is used for a test (such as leading an attack with your cyberarm), use the attribute for that limb (natural or cyber); in any other case, take the average value of all limbs involved in the task. If a task requires the careful coordination of several limbs, use the value of the weakest limb. The attributes of partial limbs (including cyberhands and - feet) may be enhanced, but their attributes only apply for tests directly involving those limbs (such as a Strength Test when gripping something with an enhanced cyberhand). Cyberlimbs cannot hold any bioware, nor any cyber-implants that take up Essence rather than Capacity. Essence cost, Capacity, and other stats can be found on the Cyberlimb table.\n\nCyberlimbs have other useful features. They give you 1 extra damage box on your Physical Condition Monitor for each cyberlimb you possess (ignore hands and feet, and partial limbs count for half a limb). They have Capacity, letting you add cyberweapons and other cyber systems that have a Capacity cost {in brackets}. They can perform at superhuman levels with the right enhancements. Cyberlimbs can be dangerous even if they don't have cyberweapons installed - their unarmed Damage Value is (STR)P.\n\nCyberlimbs: These prosthetics are basic off-the-shelf models. All standard cyberlimbs come with Strength and Agility attributes of 3. These values can only be augmented by cyberlimb enhancements, not other augmentations.\n\nCustomization: You can have your cyberlimb tailored and customized to your frame and musculature. Customization lets you add to your limb's base Strength and/or Agility ratings. Each increase of either attribute increases the limb's Availability and cost. If either of your limb's attributes are increased beyond your natural maximum for that attribute, you can't use the cyberlimb (so don't overdo it), but you can still add cyberlimb enhancements. You customize your cyberlimb when you buy it; you can't customize it after purchase, but you can add enhancements.\n\nCyberlimbs may be either obvious or synthetic.\n\nObvious cyberlimbs: These implants are immediately recognizable as artificial limbs unless you cover them with clothing. They are often chromed or matte colors but visibly mechanical in nature. Some folks like them glaringly obvious and outlandish, some find the artificiality repellant and disturbing. This can affect your social dealings in some circles, especially upper-crust society and the purist crowd.\n\nSynthetic cyberlimbs: Synthetic limbs are disguised as natural limbs. The fact that they're cybernetic gives them a -8 Concealability (the Cybertechnology skill may replace Perception for this test) when someone's just looking, but synthetic limbs are obviously artificial to the touch.",

                   "description": "In today's world of transplant-friendly bioware, the use of cyberlimbs is sometimes viewed as crude and outdated. On the other hand, they are cheap and easy to service and upgrade, so in the end they became even more popular for the less fortunate. Since cyberlimbs are more capable than most natural limbs, and you can load them up with all sorts of wiz tech, this kind of cyberware has stayed in high demand.\n\nCyberskulls and - torsos are included in the \"cyberlimbs\" category, though they are in fact shells rather than full replacements (or actual limbs).\n\nCyberlimbs have their own Strength and Agility ratings. When a particular limb is used for a test (such as leading an attack with your cyberarm), use the attribute for that limb (natural or cyber); in any other case, take the average value of all limbs involved in the task. If a task requires the careful coordination of several limbs, use the value of the weakest limb. The attributes of partial limbs (including cyberhands and - feet) may be enhanced, but their attributes only apply for tests directly involving those limbs (such as a Strength Test when gripping something with an enhanced cyberhand). Cyberlimbs cannot hold any bioware, nor any cyber-implants that take up Essence rather than Capacity. Essence cost, Capacity, and other stats can be found on the Cyberlimb table.\n\nCyberlimbs have other useful features. They give you 1 extra damage box on your Physical Condition Monitor for each cyberlimb you possess (ignore hands and feet, and partial limbs count for half a limb). They have Capacity, letting you add cyberweapons and other cyber systems that have a Capacity cost {in brackets}. They can perform at superhuman levels with the right enhancements. Cyberlimbs can be dangerous even if they don't have cyberweapons installed - their unarmed Damage Value is (STR)P.\n\nCyberlimbs: These prosthetics are basic off-the-shelf models. All standard cyberlimbs come with Strength and Agility attributes of 3. These values can only be augmented by cyberlimb enhancements, not other augmentations.\n\nCustomization: You can have your cyberlimb tailored and customized to your frame and musculature. Customization lets you add to your limb's base Strength and/or Agility ratings. Each increase of either attribute increases the limb's Availability and cost. If either of your limb's attributes are increased beyond your natural maximum for that attribute, you can't use the cyberlimb (so don't overdo it), but you can still add cyberlimb enhancements. You customize your cyberlimb when you buy it; you can't customize it after purchase, but you can add enhancements.\n\nCyberlimbs may be either obvious or synthetic.\n\nObvious cyberlimbs: These implants are immediately recognizable as artificial limbs unless you cover them with clothing. They are often chromed or matte colors but visibly mechanical in nature. Some folks like them glaringly obvious and outlandish, some find the artificiality repellant and disturbing. This can affect your social dealings in some circles, especially upper-crust society and the purist crowd.\n\nSynthetic cyberlimbs: Synthetic limbs are disguised as natural limbs. The fact that they're cybernetic gives them a -8 Concealability (the Cybertechnology skill may replace Perception for this test) when someone's just looking, but synthetic limbs are obviously artificial to the touch.",
